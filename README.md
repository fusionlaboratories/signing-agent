# Welcome to Qredo's Signing Agent

## What is Signing Agent?

Signing Agent is a programmatic member of your Qredo custody group. It enables you to setup automated approval for transactions from a Qredo wallet. To understand how to set up a Qredo Signing Agent integration [see the docs](https://developers.qredo.com/signing-agent).



The Signing Agent service provided here can operate as a standalone service (exposing a RESTful API to 3rd party applications), or as a library integrated into an application.

## Who maintains Signing Agent?

The Qredo development team is responsible for maintaining the Signing Agent. When this tool is released to the community, external contributions will be accepted. If you have issues or feedback, please [create an issue](https://github.com/qredo/signing-agent/issues) and the team will support you.

To use Signing Agent, we recommend building the [Docker image](https://developers.qredo.com/signing-agent/v2-signing-agent/docker). However, should you wish to develop or extend this tool, you can [self-build](docs/build.md).
